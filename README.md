# Rob-ASD

This repository contains code for the paper titled "Is Audio Spoof Detection Robust to Laundering Attacks?". Seven state-of-the-art (SOTA) Audio Spoof Detection systems are evaluated against laundering attacks. These systems are, 
- CQCC-GMM (https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/Baseline-CQCC-GMM/python)
- LFCC-GMM (https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/Baseline-LFCC-GMM/python)
- LFCC-LCNN (https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/Baseline-LFCC-LCNN)
- OC-Softmax (https://github.com/hashim19/AIR-ASVspoof)
- RawNet2 (https://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing)
- RawGAT-ST (https://github.com/eurecom-asp/RawGAT-ST-antispoofing)
- AASIST (https://github.com/clovaai/aasist)

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

| Folder | Description                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
|__Data Collection__|
| `/ASD_ML/` | Contains the speaker names and the youtube links to download the audio data from|
| `/Data_collection/` | Runs the pipeline for data collection|
| `/Data_collection/` | Contains the routines for slicing and transscribing audio files|
|__DeepFake Generation__|
| `/DeepFake_Generation/` | Contains funtions for clonning and generating voice from elevenlabs|
|__Model Training and Testing__|
| `/Anti_spoofing/` | Extract features from the dataset|
